						<strong>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The security of your personal data is important to us. We follow
						generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted
						to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If you have
						any questions about the security of your personal data, you can
						contact us at&nbsp;
						<a href='mailto:admin@saorsaapp.com'>admin@saorsaapp.com</a> Except
						as described under the &ldquo;Disclosure of Your Data&rdquo; section
						below, we do not provide your personal data to any third party
						without your specific consent, as defined by applicable law.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>NEWSLETTERS OR OTHER ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						If you sign up to receive promotional materials from us via email
						and/or (push notifications) we will use the data you give us to
						provide the communications you have requested. If you inform us that
						you wish to cancel email promotional materials by selecting
						&ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; at the bottom of such communication or by
						emailing us at&nbsp;
						<a href='mailto:admin@saorsaapp.com'>admin@saorsaapp.com</a> we will

					</p>
					<p>
						<br />
						<br />
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Saorsa and our analytics partners use technologies such as cookies,
						beacons, tags, and scripts to enable a service to recognize your
						device&nbsp;so you don't have to provide the same data several times
						during one task, to recognize that you may have already given a
						username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page
						requested, and to measure how people are using the Products.
					</p>
					<p>
						We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content data and
						preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain
						features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store data.
						Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing
						HTML5.
					</p>
					<p>
						We partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
						manage our advertising of the Products on other sites or platforms
						as well as across your other devices based on your past visits to
						our Website. Our third party partners may use technologies such as
						cookies to gather data about your activities within the Products to
						deliver such advertising to you, such as retargeting ads. We are not
						always able to respond to do-not-track signals. For more data about
						interest-based ads, including how to opt-out of having your
						web-browsing data used for behavioural advertising purposes, please
						visit&nbsp;<a href='about:blank'>www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.
						Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You
						may continue to receive generic ads on these third party platforms.
						You may also opt out of receiving ads across devices by adjusting
						your ad preference in your Google account.
					</p>
					<p>
						We use third party trackers to let us know when users have visited
						the Products by &ldquo;clicking-through&rdquo; our sponsored
						advertising or content hosted on third party platforms. The Products
						use Google Analytics code to gather statistical data. Google
						Analytics sets cookies to help us accurately estimate the number of
						visitors to the Products and the volumes of usage of the Products.
						This is done to ensure that the Products are available when you want
						them and are fast. For more data on how Google Analytics processes
						this data, visit&nbsp;
						<a href='about:blank'>www.google.com/analytics</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						We will acquire consent from you in order to use such trackers to
						the extent required by applicable law.
					</p>
					<p>
						For more information on the types of cookies used by Headspace and
						your ability to restrict the behavior of cookies or disable them in
						your browser&rsquo;s settings, please refer to the&nbsp;Saorsa
						Cookie Policy
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>MOBILE ANALYTICS</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand
						the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This
						software may record data such as how often you engage with the
						Products, the events that occur within the Products, aggregated
						usage and performance data, and where the Applications were
						downloaded from. We may link the data we store within the analytics
						software to any personal data you submit within the mobile
						application.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>LOG FILES</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						As true of most websites, we gather certain data and automatically
						and store it in log files. This data may include Internet Protocol
						(IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
						referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or
						clickstream data.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you receive the HTML-formatted version of our email newsletter,
						your opening of the newsletter is notified to us and saved. Your
						clicks on links in the newsletter are also saved. These and the open
						statistics are used in aggregate form to give us an indication of
						the popularity of the content and to help us make decisions about
						future content and formatting.
					</p>
					<p>
